Promatia info (also on the website):

Promatia is a new country project located in Northern Australia with its own government, currency and laws.

Promatia's historical roots go as far back as 1999, formed from large number of new nation-state projects that unified to form promatia.

Promatia is in the process of establishing a new and autonomous government, city, community, country, society and nation. Promatia is on-track to becoming a self-sufficient, sustainable and independent nation.

Our aspirations are to:

- Create a pragmatic government, led by citizens for citizens.
- Allow citizens to pursue their life goals, aided by our government.
- Develop cheap, modern infrastructure, to achieve truly high living standards.
- Modernize and digitize banking, education, governance and much more.
- Create a model for an environmentally-sustainable and economically-viable nation
- Create a safe and free society, where citizens can pursue their life goals.

We are always looking for new risk-loving and passionate citizens who want to start a new life in Promatia. Citizens can help through intellect, muscle, enterprise, finance or networking.
