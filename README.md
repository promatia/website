This is the official website of the government of Promatia.

### [Website](https://promatia.com)

Promatia is a new country project located in Northern Australia with its own government, currency and laws.

Our aspirations are to:

- Create a pragmatic government, led by citizens for citizens.
- Allow citizens to pursue their life goals, aided by our government.
- Develop cheap, modern infrastructure, to achieve truly high living standards.
- Modernize and digitize banking, education, governance and much more.
- Create a model for an environmentally-sustainable and economically-viable nation
- Create a safe and free society, where citizens can pursue their life goals.

We are always looking for new risk-loving and passionate citizens who want to start a new life in Promatia. Citizens can help through intellect, muscle, enterprise, finance or networking.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main subfolders: `/resources` and `/server`. The front-end app can be found inside the `/resources` area which includes:

- components
- layouts
- pages
- styling
- images

and other files

the `/server` folder contains API Models (eg: User) and schema's for the API. It also includes middleware for authentication, data for roles/permissions, routes. All the behind-the-scenes logic occurs here.
